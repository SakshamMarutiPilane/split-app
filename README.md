# üí∏ Split App - Backend Assignment

## üìå Problem Statement

Build a backend system that helps groups of people split expenses fairly and calculate who owes money to whom ‚Äî similar to Splitwise or Google Pay Bill Split.  
Scenarios include roommates sharing rent, friends splitting meals, or trip expenses.

This system enables:
- Adding expenses with who paid and how it's split.
- Automatic balance and settlement calculations.
- Optionally: categories, recurring expenses, analytics, and a frontend.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Expense Management
- Add new expenses (amount, description, paid by, etc.)
- Automatically adds people based on expenses.
- View all expenses with full details.
- Edit and delete any expense.
- Choose split type: equal, exact, or percentage.

### 2. Settlement Calculations
- Calculate each person‚Äôs fair share and actual spending.
- Automatically compute who owes whom.
- Show optimized transactions to minimize payments.

### 3. Data Validation & Error Handling
- Input validation: required fields, positive amounts, etc.
- Graceful handling of empty/invalid inputs.
- Descriptive error messages and proper HTTP status codes.

## üßÆSettlement Logic Explained
1. Track Total Paid by Each Person: For each expense, identify the person who paid (paidBy) and sum all such amounts for each individual.
2. Track Total Owed by Each Person: For each expense, use the splitDetails to determine how much each person owes (their fair share of that expense).
3. Calculate Net Balance: `netBalance = totalPaid - totalOwed;`
``If netBalance > 0 ‚Üí the person is owed money (creditor).
If netBalance < 0 ‚Üí the person owes money (debtor).``
4. Build Two Lists:
   a. creditors: People with positive balances.
   b. debtors: People with negative balances.
5. Optimize Settlement: Iterate through debtors and creditors.
6. For each pair: Determine the minimum of (abs(debtor‚Äôs balance), creditor‚Äôs balance).
7. Record a transaction: Debtor ‚Üí Creditor: Amount
8. Update both balances.
9. Continue until all balances are zero.
Example:
`` "Sanket owes ‚Çπ200 to Om"
"Shantanu owes ‚Çπ100 to Om"
This means these two transactions alone are sufficient to settle all debts instead of everyone paying everyone.``

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Assumptions

### üîí Assumptions:

1. Person Names are Unique & Case-Sensitive: "Shantanu" and "shantanu" are treated as two different individuals.
2. Split Details Are Always Valid: It is assumed that the frontend or API consumer will provide valid and matching split details (e.g., sum of percentages = 100%).
3. Equal Split Assumes Equal Division: For EQUAL splitType, the system equally divides the total amount among all listed persons in splitDetails.
4. All Dates are in ISO Format: Dates provided via API are assumed to be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
5. No Concurrency Handling: The app assumes that there is no simultaneous editing/deleting of expenses, as concurrency control (e.g., versioning or locks) is not implemented.
6. No Decimal Rounding Errors Handled Explicitly: Rounding is applied to two decimal places, but cumulative precision errors may still occur in rare edge cases.

### üö´ Known Limitations:

1. No User Authentication: The application does not include login or authentication mechanisms; any user can access and modify data.
2. No Multi-Group Support: All expenses are considered to be within a single group; no group or trip-level separation is implemented.
3. Simplified Recurring Logic: Recurring expenses are stored with metadata (recurring, recurrenceType, recurrenceEndDate), but actual auto-generation of future instances is not yet automated.
4. No Currency Support: All expenses are assumed to be in INR (‚Çπ). There is no support for multi-currency transactions.
5. Limited Error Handling in Frontend: The basic HTML/JS frontend currently has minimal input validation. Unexpected or malformed input can lead to errors.
6. Manual Data Entry: There‚Äôs no person management UI ‚Äî people are inferred only from expense input.
7. PDF/CSV Export is Static: The export feature captures current data as-is. It doesn‚Äôt support custom filters or grouped exports yet.
